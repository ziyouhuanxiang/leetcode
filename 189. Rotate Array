For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

[show hint]

Hint:
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

void reve(int *nums, int left, int right){
    while(left<right){
        int tmp = nums[left];
        nums[left]= nums[right];
        nums[right] = tmp;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}

void rotate(int* nums, int numsSize, int k) {
    // if(k>=numsSize)
    //     return;
    if(k>=numsSize){
        k= k%numsSize;
    }
    if(k>0){
        reve(nums,0,numsSize-1);
        reve(nums,0,k-1);
        reve(nums,k,numsSize-1);
    }
}
